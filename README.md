# facebook-group-scraper
A GUI app that allows post scraping from Facebook groups, using keywords to filter relevant posts.  
Was mainly developed to assist with finding relevant jobs, by keywords.

\b Credentials\b
Inside the GUI app, insert you credentials.

This allows you to scrape from private groups you've joined to.

If save login info is checked, the credentials will be saved in a file once you start scraping, so you won't need to enter them again.

# Groups
Add a Group ID for a group you wanna scrape from.

How to find a group id? Sometimes it will just appear in the url link - url example, if it doesn't, go into the page source and search for fb://group, the group ID will come right after.

Added groups will be saved in a file, so you'll be able to use them again once you relaunch the app. You can either remove groups you don't wanna use, or just uncheck them.
