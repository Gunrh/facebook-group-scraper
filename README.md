# facebook-group-scraper
A GUI app that allows post scraping from Facebook groups, using keywords to filter relevant posts.  
Was mainly developed to assist with finding relevant jobs, by keywords.

Credentials
Inside the GUI app, insert you credentials.

This allows you to scrape from private groups you've joined to.

If save login info is checked, the credentials will be saved in a file once you start scraping, so you won't need to enter them again.

Groups
Add a Group ID for a group you wanna scrape from.
